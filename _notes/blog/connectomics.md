Connectomics is the field interested in mapping the brain.

# Structural connectomics

*"A Deep Structured Learning Approach Towards Automating Connectome Reconstruction from 3D Electron Micrographs", <a color="#219AB3" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02974"> Funke, Tschopp, Grisaitis, Sheridan, Singh, Saalfeld, & Turaga, 2017, arXiv</a>*

*"Optimizing Random Forest Image Segmentaion for Connectomics" <a color="#219AB3" href="/assets/singh_15_rf_segmentation.pdf"> Singh, Hewitt, & Turaga 2014, Janelia Undergraduate Scholars Poster Session</a>*

Structural connectomics is interested in developing a map of how the brain is physically connected. The studies here examine electron microscopy data to produce segmentations of neurons in the fly brain.


# Functional connetomics

*"A constrained, weighted-l1 minimization approach for joint discovery of heterogeneous neural connectivity graphs" - <a color="#219AB3" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04090"> Singh, Wang, & Qi, 2017, NIPS 2017 Workshop on Advances in Modeling and Learning Interactions from Complex Data</a>.*

Functional connectomics focuses on developing maps of how brain activity in different regions is connected. The work here tries to generate maps for connectivity between 160 brain regions in the human brain. Furthermore, it analyzes how the connectivity differs between people with and without autism.
