## llm chaining / decoding

**many notes are from this [thread](https://twitter.com/iraphas13/status/1551959289023016967) on chaining models together**

- overviews
  - Ai chains: Transparent and controllable human-ai interaction by chaining LLM prompts ([wu, terry, & cai, 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517582)) - chaining LLM steps together: output of one step becomes the input for the next
    - interactive system where users can modify chains + their intermediate results -- improves performance + human experience
  - Language Model Cascades ([dohan...sutton, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10342)) - treat chaining models as probabilistic programs
    - use a probabilistic-programming language (PPL) to define a joint probability model on string-valued random variables, parameterized using LMs, and then condition this model on string-valued observations in order to compute a posterior over string-valued unknowns
    - self-PPLs extend probabilistic graphical models to support more complex joint distributions whose size and “shape” can itself be stochastic
      - e.g., a graph unrolled for a random number of iterations, until a data-dependent stopping criterion is met
      - variables are all text: questions $Q$, answers $A$, and intermediate thoughts $T$
  - Prover-Verifier Games improve legibility of LLM outputs ([kirchner, chen, ... leike, mcaleese, & burda, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13692)) - trained strong LMs to produce text that is easy for weak LMs to verify and found that this training also made the text easier for humans to evaluate.

      - Language Models Don't Always Say What They Think: Unfaithful Explanations in Chain-of-Thought Prompting ([turpin, ..., bowman, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04388))

## model merging

Model merging (some of these are non-transformer papers) = combine different models that have the same architecture (see collection of papers [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/osanseviero/model-merging-65097893623330a3a51ead66) and huggingface blog post [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/merge-models)).

- all layers are same dimension and each attention block **adds** a vector to it
- Although they’re parameterized as separate matrices, $W_O W_V$ and $W_Q^T W_K$ can always be thought of as individual, low-rank matrices
  - $x \in \mathbb R^{d_{embed} \times d_{sequence}}$: $d_{embed}$ can be hundreds - tens of thousands

  - $A = \text{softmax}(x^TW_Q^TW_kx) \in \mathbb R^{d_{sequence} \times d_{sequence}}$
- if we have a 0-layer net (e.g. predict next token with linear layer given current token), we just learn bigram log-likelihood
- 2 circuits
  - QK circuit determines which "source" token the present "destination" token attends back to and copies information from
    - $W_{E}^{T} W_{Q}^{T} W_{K} W_{E} \in \mathbb R ^{d_{vocab} \times d_{vocab}}$
  - OV circuit describes what the resulting effect on the "out" predictions for the next token is
    - $W_{U} W_{O} W_{V} W_{E} \in \mathbb R ^{d_{vocab} \times d_{vocab}}$
- if a single head increases the probability of both `keep… in mind` and `keep… at bay`, it *must* also increase the probability of `keep… in bay` and `keep… at mind`
- **induction heads** search previous examples of present token
  - If they don't find it, they attend to the first token and do nothing
  - if they do find it, they then look at the *next* token and copy it. This allows them to repeat previous sequences of tokens, both exactly and approximately
  - sometimes can do some kind of "fuzzy" matching
- tensor/kronecker product $\bigotimes$:
  - Left-right multiplying: Multiplying $x$ by a tensor product $A \otimes W$ is equivalent to simultaneously left and right multiplying: $(A \otimes W) x=A x W^{T}$
  - When we add them, it is equivalent to adding the results of this multiplication: $\left(A_{1} \otimes W_{1}+A_{2} \otimes W_{2}\right) x=A_{1} x W_{1}^{T}+A_{2} x W_{2}^{T}$ 
  **[Softmax Linear Units](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html)**
- replacing activation function with softmax linear unit increases fraction of MLP neurons which are "interpretable", i.e. correspond to meaningful features
  - however, may “hide” some non-neuron-aligned features by decreasing their magnitude and then later recovering it with LayerNorm
- the presence of nonlinear activation functions createse an incentive for features to align with this basis and not get superposed
  - if the gains to sparse coding are large enough, this incentive will get overwhelmed
- ways to combat polysemanticity
  - activation sparsity
  - lateral inhibition / co-occurrence sparsity
  - weight sparsity
  - superlinear activation functions
  - increase neurons per param
- $\text{SoLU}(x) = x \cdot \text{softmax}(x)$
  - adds lateral inhibition, superlinearity, approximate sparsity
  - changes GeLU, which is approximately $\text{sigmoid}(1.7x) \cdot x$
  - just changing to SoLU decrease performance, had to add LayerNorm afterwards

## privacy

- Training Data Extraction From Pre-trained Language Models: A Survey ([ishihara, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16157))
  - definitions
    - *eidetic memorization* -  a string s is k-eidetic memorized by LLM $f$ if a prompt p exists such that $f(p) = s$ and s appears at most k times in the training set
      - slightly different definition: a string s is k-memorized with k tokens of context from LLM f if a (length-k) string p exists such that the concatenation p + s is contained in the training set, and f produces s when prompted with p by using greedy decoding

    - *differential privacy* = removing any data from the training set should not considerably change trained models
    - *counterfactual memorization* = difference between a training data’s expected loss under a model that has and has not been trained on that data
    - some studies loosen the definition of memorization using a similarity metric for strings rather than exact string matching

- Extracting Training Data from LLMs ([carlini, …, raffel, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805)) - LLMs are particularly likely to memorize atypical data points

([brown, …, tramer, 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3534642)) - “privacy-preserving” LM should guarantee that a user’s data cannot ever appear (or be inferable) outside the context they originally expected it to appear in
  - Can Neural Network Memorization Be Localized? ([maini, …, lipton, kolter, zhang, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09542)) - memorization is often confined to a small number of neurons or channels, propose example-tied dropout to direct memorization to few neurons

## architecture/attention variants

- state space models (good overview in [albert gu thesis](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/14784021), 2023)
  - S4: *structured* state space models ([gu...re, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396)) - similar to RNNs but can predict all outputs at once via convolution
    - the core of the state space model is basically a linear RNN
      - inputs x, hidden states h, outputs y
      - 3 matrices: $A, B, C$
      - $y_i = C h_i$
      - $h_i = A h_{i-1} + B x_i$
        - note: there is no nonlinearity between hidden states
        - note: the transition from one hidden state to the next is the same for all positions (except for the input)
      - can compute hidden states simultaneously by just pre-multiplying these A and B matrices with x the right number of times ( a convolution operation)
  - mamba: *selective* state space models ([gu & dao, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752))
    - changes (2) above -- the transition from one hidden state to the next now depends on the input (making it closer to LSTMs)
      - $B = B(x)$
      - $C = C(x)$
  - RNNs are not Transformers (Yet): The Key Bottleneck on In-context Retrieval ([wen, dang, & lyu, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18510)) - RNNs fail to retrieve info from long contexts, RAG helps

    - From Denoising Diffusions to Denoising Markov Models ([benton...doucet, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03595))
    - Not clear that these are better than just iteratively masking/replacing a word with BERT


## mixture of experts (MoE) / routing

mixture of experts models have become popular because of the need for (1) fast speed / low memory at test time while still (2) having a large model during training

- note: nowadays often the "experts" are different MLPs following the self-attention layers (since their computations can be computed independently)
- A Review of Sparse Expert Models in Deep Learning ([fedus, jeff dean, zoph, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01667))
  - sparsity decouples the parameter count from the compute per example allowing for extremely large, but efficient models
  - routing algorithm - determines where to send examples
    - discreteness makes it difficult
      - some works use RL to learn routing
      - standard approach uses gumbel-softmax
      - usually get matrix of similarities between input tokens and experts and route based on these
        - sometimes route to topk experts rather than top1
    - load balancing - usually add an auxiliary loss to encourage equal tokens being sent to different experts
- non-specialized experts
  - Early versions ([Jacobs, michael jordan, nowlan, & hinton, 1991](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6797059)) had independent feed-forward networks serving as experts
  - Sparsely-gated MOE layer ([Shazeer...quoc le, hinton, dean, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538)) have been studied with token-based routing with backprop
  - replace FFN in transformers with expert layers
    - GShard [Lepikhin et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16668), which appplies this concept to machine translation
    - Switch transformers ([Fedus et al. (2022)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0998/21-0998.pdf)) simplifies the architecture to activation of only one expert per layer
  - BASE Layers [Lewis et al. (2021)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/lewis21a.html) - find an alternative approach to routing by formulating it as a linear assignment problem
  - Hash layers [Roller et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04426) use a fixed hash as the gating function
  - THOR ([zuo, liu...zhao, gao, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04260)) - randomly route to different experts then merge at the parameter level at test time
- [routing notes](https://www.sscardapane.it/assets/files/nnds2022/Lecture_8_Dynamic_NNs.pdf) - make hard decision but still want to learn probabilities
  - straight-through estimator (STE) - take the argmax during the forward pass, while considering the original probabilities in the backward pass
    - highly biased
  - gumbel-softmax- allows for better sampling
- specialized experts as fully independent models (sometimes for multi-task learning)
  - DEmix Layers ([Gururangan...smith, zettlemoyer, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05036)) --  DEMix layers – placed in the feedforward layers of the Transformer – contain experts which specialize on specific domains. Routing at train time is determined only by the domain label, but all experts are activated at inference time and mixed according to weights estimated from a validation set
  - [Sparsely Activated Mixture-of-Experts are Robust Multi-Task Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07689) (gupta...awadallah, gao, 2022) - use task description to improve routing
  - [Pfeiffer et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06266) - multilingual expert model with language-specific routing

- Interpretable Mixture of Experts ([ismail...pfister, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02107)) - each sample assigned to single expert for prediction
  - InterpretCC: Intrinsic User-Centric Interpretability through Global Mixture of Experts ([swamy...kaser, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02933v2)) - first, discriminator predicts which features are important. Then, all other features are masked and used for prediction. The discriminator network can additionally select a different network to send different features to

    - TPR roles and fillers can both be made continuous
  
  - neural space vs symbolic space (many different things (e.g. sentences) can mean the same thing) - word vectors can be thought of as “soft symbols”
  - want to move from symbolic repr. to neural repr. while keeping interpretability

## external memory

- memorizing transformers ([wu...szegedy, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08913)) - knn-based learned indexing + retrieval at training time
  - at test time, you just need to index the entire context and the model will be able to use it

- Memory Networks ([weston, chopra, & bordes, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916)) - external KB that can be read / written to (stores plain text)
    - End-To-End Memory Networks ([sukhbaatar, szlam, weston, & fergus, 2015](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/hash/8fb21ee7a2207526da55a679f0332de2-Abstract.html)) - trained with less supervision for memory reading/writing
- SILO Language Models: Isolating Legal Risk In a Nonparametric Datastore ([min…smith, zettlemoyer, 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04430.pdf))
  - Use a parametric LM on open data then one of 2 nonparametric datastores: kNN LM or retrieval in-context

  - motivation: hard to scale ngram models to large datasets and large data lengths
  - soln 1: backoff ([Jurafsky & Martin, 2000](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uZg9l58AAAAJ&citation_for_view=uZg9l58AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)) - select *n* based on the longest suffix of the prompt that has a non-zero count in the corpus
    - counts of the next token yield the prob. of the next token
    - Katz backoff ([Katz, 1987](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1165125)) discounts probs to yield valid prob. distr.
  - soln 2: represent prob. table in [suffix array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array) to make things very fast
    - suffix array stores address to each location in the training data alphabetically sorted
      - roughly the same size
    - this makes it fast to search for instances of an ngram (and also for what precedes/follows it)
  - results show that infinigram can considerably improve perplexities when it is linearly combined with the logits from LLMs (experiments up to llama-2 70B)
  - Transformers Can Represent n-gram Language Models ([svete & cotterell, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14994)) - transformers have the computational capacity to represent ngram models
  - Generalization through Memorization: Nearest Neighbor Language Models ([khandelwal, levy, jurafsky, zettlemoyer, & lewis, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00172)) - average over output of neighboring embeddings
- Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory ([graves…hassabis, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101)) [see [blog post](https://jaspock.github.io/funicular/dnc.html)]
    - differentiable neural computer (DNC) - neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix
    - stores external memory matrix
        - reads from memory via multiplying by a vector (e.g. one-hot vector would yield single element)
    - extends Neural turing machines ([graves, wayne, & danihelka, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401))
- Hopfield Networks is All You Need ([ramsaeur...hochreiter, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217))
    - keys: each input has a key vector which "represents info about this input" (e.g. this is a noun)
    - queries: each input has a query vector which "asks for other inputs that would be useful context" (e.g. what adjectives describe this word)
      - in self-attention these queries also come from the input whereas in just regular attention they come from somewhere else (e.g. the output of a translation task)
    - transformer finds similarity between each key with each query then takes softmax - this provides weights for each of the inputs, as context for the original input
      - in transformer, these weights are used to weight the values but in hopfield nets we would take a weighted sum of the keys and feed it back as the input
    - as we update becomes more skewed towards the things that match the most

## multilingual stuff

**multilingual learning**

- Multilingual Jailbreak Challenges in Large Language Models ([deng…bing, 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vESNKdEMGp)) - jailbreaks work better in low-resource languages - propose to remedy this by safety finetuning on multilingual data
- *Evaluating and Mitigating Linguistic Discrimination in Large Language Models* ([dong…wang, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18534)) - translate all queries into multiple languages and then get the response from the model, and then convert the responses to English and give the answer that has highest similarities to other answers
- *Getting More from Less: Large Language Models are Good Spontaneous Multilingual Learners* ([zhang...huang, 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13816v2)) - applying logit lens finds that model internally translates to english in multilingual tasks
- *Low-Resource Languages Jailbreak GPT-4* ([Yong...Bach 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446)): exact same result as the [deng…bing, 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vESNKdEMGp) paper — low resource languages have much higher ASR than high resource languages. They translated AdvBench in 12 languages and did it.
- *A Cross-Language Investigation into Jailbreak Attacks in Large Language Models* ([Li...Xue 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16765)): Not a well written paper. Findings: GPT4 does not experience difference in ASR across languages, whereas worse models do (for the unintentional case) — similar to our finding for GPT4. They have done some attention visualization for intentional, unintensional, and multilingual case — not in a good manner. Their mitigation is finetuning Vicuna model with questions in multiple languages. This paper created its own dataset and used Microsoft Translate for translation.
- *Comprehensive Evaluation of ChatGPT Reliability Through Multilingual Inquiries* ([Puttaparthi…Yu 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10524)): Constructed their own multilingual dataset, 30 malicious questions translated into 121 languages (Google Translate). Show that some languages have higher ASR than others (low resources ones, but they also generate lot of invalid responses). RQ2 is the interesting study, where they parts of a single question in different languages and mandated response in that language — it increased the ASR. This is useful.
- MindMerger: Efficient Boosting LLM Reasoning in non-English Languages ([huang…yuan, 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17386)) - merge capabilities across languages

**multilingual representations**

- Discovering Low-rank Subspaces for Language-agnostic Multilingual Representations ([xie…li, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05792)) - unsupervised monolingual approach to identify language-specific subspace, then project it out
  - A Simple and Effective Method To Eliminate the Self Language Bias in Multilingual Representations ([yang…darve, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04727))
    - Other works look at token-level tasks for language-agnostic embeddings (e.g. [gonen…goldberg, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08275))
- First Align, then Predict: Understanding the Cross-Lingual Ability of Multilingual BERT ([muller…seddah, 2021](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C48&q=First+Align%2C+then+Predict%3A+Understanding+the+Cross-Lingual+Ability+of+Multilingual+BERT&btnG=))
  - the model first aligns representations of different languages together, and then (starting from the middle layers) makes them more language-specific again (to accompany the language-specific training objective)
- Cross-lingual Similarity of Multilingual Representations Revisited ([del & fishel, 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.15.pdf))
  - measure similarity with Averaged Neuron-Wise Correlation (ANC)
- Discovering Language-neutral Sub-networks in Multilingual Language Models ([foroutan…aberer, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12672))

**cipher attacks on LLMs**

- *GPT-4 Is Too Smart To Be Safe: Stealthy Chat with LLMs via Cipher* ([Yuan…Tu 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06463)): This is similar to ASCII paper, that when instructed to talk in CIPHER, it can bypass model safety filters. However, if the model has never seen a CIPHER like morse or Caesar than the outputs are hardly valid. Outputs are only valid for ASCII and self-cipher. However, in both these cases one needs atleast 3 unsafe demos that can be recognized by a filter in the input space. Research Problem: So can we design a cipher that has high validity and cannot be detected in the input space with a classifier (self cipher can be, maybe other ciphers cannot be).
- *ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned LLMs* ([Xu...Poovendran 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11753)): Basically mixing text with ascii increases the AST by a lot, renders defense much less effective. This is similar to mixing english with words from other languages like in ([Puttaparthi…Yu 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10524)). They first show that LLMs have poor performance in recognizing ASCII, but not that poor, so the attack can still be executed. They also execute this as a nested attacked (which are the most successful I think). Experiment section well written, lot of baselines and relevant papers. So basically LLMs will execute the attack if it can do some basic understanding, but has not seen that kind of input much in real world.
- Jailbreaking Proprietary Large Language Models using Word Substitution Cipher ([Handa…Baral 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601)): short nice paper! just says substitute unsafe words with safe words, provide the mapping to the model and the original question substituted with the words. Ask the LLM to reply, high ASR for ChatGPT and Gemini.
- CodeChameleon: Personalized Encryption Framework for Jailbreaking Large Language Models ([Lv…Huang 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16717)): In this case they ask the malicious question using code where the input sentence is encrypted using some simple coding schemes (reverse words or sort words by their length) and the code includes the decryption function. Highest ASR among all baselines which includes the CipherChat and multilingual.
- MULTIVERSE: Exposing Large Language Model Alignment Problems in Diverse Worlds ([Jin…Zhang 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01706)): This is not doing cipher language. It creates several layers of alternate worlds where one can put a malicious query and it bypasses model security. The deeper the layers, the higher ASR the attack has.
- Data Contamination Can Cross Language Barriers ([feng yao, yufan zhuang, ..., jingbo shang](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13236v1)) - LLMs can overfit to benchmarks by being trained on translations of them
  - To detect this contamination, for each question, we replace all the incorrect choices with correct choices taken from other questions

# basics

![kv_caching_diagram](../assets/kv_caching_diagram.png)

- **attention** = vector of importance weights
  - to predict or infer one element, such as a pixel in an image or a word in a sentence, we estimate using the attention vector how strongly it is correlated with (or “*attends to*” other elements and take the sum of their values weighted by the attention vector as the approximation of the target
- vanilla transformer: multihead attention, add + norm, position-wise ffn, add + norm
- self-attention layer [implementation](https://github.com/mertensu/transformer-tutorial), [mathematics](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/docs/transformers.pdf), and **chandan's self-attention [cheat-sheet](https://slides.com/chandansingh-2/deck-51f404)**

## mathematical overview of transformers

- based on [Formal Algorithms for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
- tasks
  - *sequence modeling*: learn $p(x)$, usually factorized as $p(x_i|x_1,...,x_{i-1})$
  - *sequence-to-sequence*: learn $p(z|x)$, e.g. transalation, speech-to-text, question answering
- preprocessing
  - embedding matrix takes in one-hot tokens and linearly maps them to a vector
  - positional embedding of a token is usually added to the token embedding to form a token’s initial embedding
- attention types
  - *Bidirectional / unmasked self-attention* - primary/context vectors are the same
  - *Unidirectional / masked self-attention* - mask scores from before a given word
  - *Cross-attention* - primary/context vectors can come from different places
- non-attention
  - layernorm: controls mean/variance of activations
    - RMSnorm: simpler version, sets mean/offset to zero
- unembedding
  - linear layer (with softmax) that outputs size of original vocab
    - sometimes fixed to be transpose of the embedding matrix
- predictions
  - predict next word using single linear layer on hidden state from previous word
  - finetune classification head often only using linear layer on first token from sequence

- architectures
  - initially, encoder-decoder was common, but now often no decoder

## visual explanation of self-attention

-  based on article by jay allamar

- **self-attention ** - layer that lets word learn its relation to other layers
  - for each word, want score telling how much importance to place on each other word (queries $\cdot$ keys)
  - we get an encoding for each word
    - the encoding of each word returns a weighted sum of the values of the words (the current word gets the highest weight)
    - softmax this and use it to do weighted sum of values![Screen Shot 2019-08-17 at 2.51.53 PM](../assets/attention.png)
  - (optional) implementation details
    - **multi-headed attention** - just like having many filters, get many encodings for each word
      - each one can take input as the embedding from the previous attention layer
    - **position vector** - add this into the embedding of each word (so words know how far apart they are) - usually use sin/cos rather than actual position number
    - **padding mask** - add zeros to the end of the sequence
    - **look-ahead mask** - might want to mask to only use previous words (e.g. if our final task is decoding)
    - **residual + normalize** - after self-attention layer, often have residual connection to previous input, which gets added then normalized
  - decoder - each word only allowed to attend to previous positions
  - 3 components
    - queries
    - keys
    - values
- **attention**
  - encoder reads input and ouputs context vector after each word
  - decoder at each step uses a different weighted combination of these context vectors
    - specifically, at each step, decoder concatenates its hidden state w/ the attention vector (the weighted combination of the context vectors)
    - this is fed to a feedforward net to output a word
    - ![Screen Shot 2019-04-11 at 7.57.14 PM](../assets/nmt.png)
  - at a high level we have $Q, K, V$ and compute $\text{softmax}(QK^T)V$
    - instead could simplify it and do $\text{softmax}(XX^T)V$ - this would then be based on kernel
- **transformer**
  - uses many self-attention layers
  - many stacked layers in encoder + decoder (not rnn: self-attention + feed forward)
  - details
    - initial encoding: each word -> vector
    - each layer takes a list of fixed size (hyperparameter e.g. length of longest sentence) and outputs a list of that same fixed size (so one output for each word)
      - can easily train with a masked word to predict the word at the predicted position in the encoding
  - multi-headed attention has several of each of these (then just concat them)

## huggingface tutorial

Broadly, models can be grouped into three categories:

- GPT-like (also called *auto-regressive* Transformer models)
- BERT-like (also called *auto-encoding* Transformer models)
- BART/T5-like (also called *sequence-to-sequence* Transformer models)
- [Handling multiple sequences - Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter2/5?fw=pt)
  - pad sequences to have the same length (need to modify attention masks to ignore the padded values)

## pre-transformer nlp models

- rnns
  - when training rnn, accumulate gradients over sequence and then update all at once
  - **stacked rnns** have outputs of rnns feed into another rnn
  - bidirectional rnn - one rnn left to right and another right to left (can concatenate, add, etc.)
- standard seq2seq
  - encoder reads input and outputs context vector (the hidden state)
  - decoder (rnn) takes this context vector and generates a sequencefagoa
