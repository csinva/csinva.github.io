{:toc}

- [Meansâ€“ends analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means%E2%80%93ends_analysis) - for planning subgoals, use the distance-to-the-goal as a continuous reward signal (and basically do greedy search with backtracking)
- at test-time, we solve an optimization problem

# game trees - R&N 5.2-5.5

- like search (adversarial search)
- *minimax algorithm*
  - *ply* - half a move in a tree
  - for multiplayer, the backed-up value of a node n is the vector of the successor state with the highest value for the player choosing at n
  - time complexity - $O(b^m)$
  - space complexity - $O(bm)$ or even $O(m)$
- *alpha-beta* pruning cuts in half the exponential depth
  - once we have found out enough about n, we can prune it
  - depends on move-ordering
    - might want to explore best moves = *killer moves* first
  - *transposition table* can hash different movesets that are just transpositions of each other
- imperfect real-time decisions
  - can evaluate nodes with a heuristic and cutoff before reaching goal
  - heuristic uses features
  - want *quiescent search* - consider if something dramatic will happen in the next ply
    - *horizon effect* - a position is bad but isn't apparent for a few moves
    - *singular extension* - allow searching for certain specific moves that are always good at deeper depths
  - *forward pruning* - ignore some branches
    - *beam search* - consider only n best moves
    - PROBCUT prunes some more
- search vs lookup
  - often just use lookup in the beginning
  - program can solve and just lookup endgames
- stochastic games
  - include *chance nodes*
  - change minimax to expectiminimax
  - $O(b^m numRolls^m)$
  - cutoff evaluation function is sensitive to scaling - evaluation function must be a positive linear transformation of the probability of winning from a position
  - can do alpha-beta pruning analog if we assume evaluation function is bounded in some range
  - alternatively, could simulate games with *Monte Carlo simulation*

## utilities / decision theory -- R&N 16.1-16.3, mazzonni quant finance book

- **lottery** - any function of a random variable
- **utility function** - lottery that satisfiers certain properties (e.g. transitivity)
  - expected utility = *von Neumann-Morgenstern* utility
- goal: maximize utility by taking actions (focus on single actions)
  - utility function U(s) gives utility of a state
  - actions are probabilistic: $P[RESULT(a)=s' \vert a,e]$
    - s - state, e - observations, a - action
- soln: pick action with *maximum expected utility*
  - expected utility $EU(a\vert e) = \sum_{s'} P(RESULT(a)=s' \vert a,e) U(s')$
- notation
  - A>B - agent prefers A over B
  - A~B - agent is indifferent between A and B
- preference relation has 6 *axioms of utility theory*
  1. *orderability* - A>B, A~B, or A<B
  2. *transitivity*
  3. *continuity*
  4. *substitutability* - can do algebra with preference eqns
  5. *monotonicity* - if A>B then must prefer higher probability of A than B
  6. *decomposability* - 2 consecutive lotteries can be compressed into single equivalent lottery
- these axioms yield a utility function
  - isn't unique (ex. affine transformation yields new utility function)
  - *value function* = *ordinal utility function* - sometimes ranking, numbers not needed
  - agent might not be explicitly maximizing the utility function

## utility functions

- *preference elicitation* - finds utility function
  - normalized utility to have min and max value
  - assess utility of s by asking agent to choose between s and $(p: \min, (1-p): \max)$
- people have complicated utility functions
  - ex. *micromort* - one in a million chance of death
  - ex. *QALY* - quality-adjusted life year
- risk
  - agents exhibits *monotonic preference* for more money
  - gambling has expected monetary value = EMV
  - *risk averse* = when utility of money is sublinear
    - **risk premium** = value agent will accept in lieu of lottery = *certainty equivalent*= *insurance premium*
  - *risk-neutral* = linear
  - *risk-seeking* = supralinear
  - **absolute risk aversion** $ARA(x) = - \frac{u''(x)}{u'(x)} $ : higher is more risk averse
  - **relative risk aversion** $ARA(x) = - \frac{x \cdot u''(x)}{u'(x)} $
- *optimizer's curse* - tendency for E[utility] to be too high because we keep picking high utility randomness
- *normative theory* - how idealized agents work
- *descriptive theory* - how actual agents work
  - *certainty effect* - people are drawn to things that are certain
  - *ambiguity aversion*
  - *framing effect* - wording can influence people's judgements
  - *anchoring effect* - buy middle-tier wine because expensive is there

# decision theory / VPI -- R&N 16.5 & 16.6

- note: here we are just making 1 decision
- *decision network* (sometimes called *influence diagram*)
  1. *chance nodes* - represent RVs (like BN)
  2. *decision nodes* - points where decision maker has a choice of actions
  3. *utility nodes* - represent agent's utility function
- can ignore chance nodes
  - then *action-utility function* = *Q-function* maps directly from actions to utility

![decision_nets](../assets/decision_nets.png)

- evaluation
  1. set evidence
  2. for each possible value of decision node
    - set decision node to that value
    - calculate probabilities of parents of utility node
    - calculate resulting utility
  3. return action with highest utility

## the value of information

- *information value theory* - enables agent to choose what info to acquire
  - observations only affect agent's belief state
  - value of info = difference in best expected value with/without info
  - maximum $EU(\alpha|e) = \underset{a}{\max} \sum_{s'} P(Result(a)=s'|a, e) U(s')$
- *value of perfect information VPI* - assume we can obtain exact evidence for a variable (ex. variable $T=t$)
  - $VPI(T) =  \mathbb{E}_{T}\left[ EU(\alpha|e, T) \right] - \underbrace{EU(\alpha \vert e)}_{\text{original EU}}$
  - first term expands to $\sum_t P(T=t \vert e) \cdot EU(\alpha \vert  e, T=t) $
    - within each of these EU, we take a max over actions
  - VPI not linearly additive, but is order-independent
  - intuition
    - info is more valuable when it is likely to cause a change of plan
    - info is more valuable when the new plan will be much better than the old plan
- information-gathering agent
  - *myopic* - greedily obtain evidence which yields highest VPI until some threshold
  - *conditional plan* - considers more things

# mdps and rl - R&N 17.1-17.4

- sequences of actions
- *fully observable* - agent knows its state
- *markov decision process* - all these things are given
  - set of states s
  - set of actions a
  - stochastic transition model $P(s' \vert s,a)$
  - reward function $R(s)$
    - utility aggregates rewards, for models more complex than mdps reward can be a function of past sequences of actions / observations
- want policy $\pi (s)$ - what action to do in state s
  - optimal policy yields highest expected utlity
- optimizing MDP - *multiattribute utility theory*
  - could sum rewards, but results are infinite
  - instead define objective function (maps infinite sequences of rewards to single real numbers)
    - ex. discounting to prefer earlier rewards (most common)
      - discount reward n steps away by $\gamma^n, 0<\gamma<1$
    - ex. set a *finite horizon* and sum rewards
      - optimal action in a given state could change over time = *nonstationary*
    - ex. average reward rate per time step
    - ex. agent is guaranteed to get to terminal state eventually - *proper policy*
- expected utility executing $\pi$: $U^\pi (s) = \mathbb E_{s_1,...,s_t}\left[\sum_t \gamma^t R(s_t)\right]$
  - when we use discounted utilities, $\pi$ is independent of starting state
  - $\pi^*(s) = \underset{\pi}{\text{argmax}} \: U^\pi (s) = \underset{a}{\text{argmax}} \sum_{s'} P(s' \vert s,a) U(s')$
- *experience replay* - instead of learning from samples one by one, want to reduce correlation between subsequent samples
  - take a large batch of samples and sample randomly from it, rather than going sequentially

## value iteration

- *value iteration* - calculates utility of each state and uses utilities to find optimal policy
  - *bellman eqn*: $U(s) = R(s) + \gamma \: \underset{a}{\max} \sum_{s'} P(s' \vert s, a) U(s')$
  - start with arbitrary utilities
  - recalculate several times with *Bellman update* to approximate solns to bellman eqn
- value iteration eventually converges
  - *contraction* - function that brings variables together
    - contraction only has 1 fixed point
    - Bellman update is a contraction on the space of utility vectors and therefore converges
    - error is reduced by factor of $\gamma$ each iteration
  - also, terminating condition: if $ \vert  \vert U_{i+1}-U_i \vert  \vert  < \epsilon (1-\gamma) / \gamma$ then $ \vert  \vert U_{i+1}-U \vert  \vert <\epsilon$
  - what actually matters is *policy loss* $ \vert  \vert U^{\pi_i}-U \vert  \vert $ - the most the agent can lose by executing $\pi_i$ instead of the optimal policy $\pi^*$
    - if $ \vert  \vert U_i -U \vert  \vert  < \epsilon$ then $ \vert  \vert U^{\pi_i} - U \vert  \vert  < 2\epsilon \gamma / (1-\gamma)$

## policy iteration

- another way to find optimal policies
  1. *policy evaluation* - given a policy $\pi_i$, calculate $U_i=U^{\pi_i}$, the utility of each state if $\pi_i$ were to be executed
    - like value iteration, but with a set policy so there's no max
      - $U_i(s) = R(s) + \gamma \: \sum_{s'} P(s' \vert s, \pi_i(s)) U_i(s')$
      - can solve exactly for small spaces, or approximate (set of lin. eqs.)
  2. *policy improvement* - calculate a new MEU policy $\pi_{i+1}$ using $U_i$
    - same as above, just $\pi^*(s) = \underset{\pi}{\text{argmax}} \: U^\pi (s) = \underset{a}{\text{argmax}} \sum_{s'} P(s' \vert s,a) U'(s)$
- *asynchronous policy iteration* - don't have to update all states at once

## partially observable markov decision processes (POMDP)

- agent is not sure what state it's in

- same elements but add *sensor model* $P(e \vert s)$

- have distr $b(s)$ for belief states
  - updates like the HMM: $b'(s') = \alpha P(e \vert s') \sum_s P(s' \vert s, a) b(s)$
  - changes based on observations

- optimal action depends only on the agent's current belief state

  - use belief states as the states of an MDP and solve as before
  - changes because state space is now continuous

- value iteration
  1. expected utility of executing p in belief state is just $b \cdot \alpha_p$  (dot product)
  2. $U(b) = U^{\pi^*}(b)=\underset{p}{\max} \: b \cdot \alpha_p$
  - belief space is continuous [0, 1] so we represent it as piecewise linear, and store these discrete lines in memory
    - do this by iterating and keeping any values that are optimal at some point
      - remove *dominated plans*
  - generally this is far too inefficient

- *dynamic decision network* - online agent ![](../assets/online_pomdp.png) 

# reinforcement learning -- R&N 21.1-21.6

- *reinforcement learning* - use observed rewards to learn optimal policy for the environment
  - in ch 17, agent had model of environment ($P(s'|s, a)$ and $R(s)$)
- 2 problems
  - *passive* - given $\pi$, learn $U^\pi (s)$
  - *active* - *explore* states to find utilities and *exploit* to get highest reward
- 2 model types, 3 agent designs
  - model-based: can predict next state/reward before taking action (for MDP, requires learning $P(s'|s,a)$)
    - *utility-based agent* - learns $U(S)$ - utility function on states
      - requires model of the environment
  - model-free 
    - *Q-learning agent*: learns $Q(s, a)$ - *action-utility function* = *Q-function* maps actions $\to$ utility
    - *reflex agent*: learns $Q(s)$ - policy that maps directly from states to actions

## passive reinforcement learning (estimate value function given policy)

- given policy $\pi$, learn $U^\pi (s) = \mathbb E\left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(S_t)\right]$
  
  - like policy evaluation, but transition model / reward function are unknown
- **direct utility estimation**: treat states independently
  - run trials to sample utility
  - average to get expected total reward for each state = expected total reward from each state
- **adaptive dynamic programming** (ADP) - 2 steps
  - sample to estimate transition model $P(s'|s, a)$ and rewards $R(s)$
  - find $U^\pi(s)$ with the Bellman eqn (plug in at each step)
  - we might want to enforce a prior on the model (two ways)
    1. *Bayesian reinforcement learning* - assume a prior $P(h)$ on transition model h
      - use prior to calculate $P(h \vert e)$
      - use $P(h|e)$ to calculate optimal policy: $\pi^* = \underset{\pi}{argmax} \sum_h P(h \vert e) u_h^\pi$
        - $u_h^\pi$= expected utility over all possible start states, obtained by executing policy $\pi$ in model h
    2. *robust control theory* - give best outcome in the worst case over H
      - $\pi^* = \underset{\pi}{argmax}\:  \underset{h}{\min} \: u_h^\pi$
  
- **temporal-difference learning** - adjust utility estimates towards local equilibrium for correct utilities
  - like an approximation of ADP
  - when we transition $s \to s'$, update $U^\pi(s) = U^\pi (s) + \alpha \left[R(s) - U^\pi (s) + \gamma \:U^\pi (s') \right]$
    - $\alpha$ should decrease over time to converge
  - *prioritized sweeping* - prefer adjustments to states whose likely successors have just undergone a large adjustment in their own utility estimates (speeds things up)

## active reinforcement learning

- no longer following set policy

  - *explore* states to find their utilities and *exploit* model to get highest reward

  - must explore all actions, not just those in the policy

- *bandit* problems - determining exploration policy
  - *n-armed bandit* - pulling n levelers on a slot machine, each with different distr.
  - *Gittins index* - function of number of pulls / payoff
  
- coorect schemes should be *GLIE* - greedy in the limit of infinite exploration - visits all states infinitely, but eventually become greedy

### agent examples

- ex. choose random action $1/t$ of the time
- ex. active adp agent
  - give optimistic utility to relatively unexplored states
  - uses *exploration function* f(u, numTimesVisited) around the sum in the bellman eqn
    - high utilities will propagate
- ex. active TD agent
  - now must learn transitions (same as adp)
  - update rule same as passive TD

### learning action-utility function $Q(s, a)$

- $U(s) = \underset{a}{\max} \: Q(s,a)$
  - ADP version: $Q(s, a) = R(s) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s, a) \underset{a'}{\max} Q(s', a')$
  - TD version: $Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \alpha [R(s) - Q(s,a) + \gamma \: \underset{a'}{\max} Q(s', a')]$ - **this is what is usually referred to as Q-learning**
  - this is *off-policy* (only uses best Q-value, doesn't pay attention to actualy policy being followed) - more flexible
- *SARSA* (state-action-reward-state-action) is related: $Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \alpha [R(s) + \gamma \: Q(s', a') - Q(s,a) ]$
  - here, $a'$ is action actually taken
  - SARSA is *on-policy* (pays attention to actual policy being followed) 
- can approximate Q-function with something other than a lookup table
  - ex. linear function of parameters $\hat{U}_\theta(s) = \theta_1f_1(s) + ... + \theta_n f_n(s)$
    - can learn params online with *delta rule* = *wildrow-hoff rule*: $\theta_i = \theta - \alpha \: \frac{\partial Loss}{\partial \theta_i}$

## policy search

- keep twiddling the policy as long as it improves, then stop
  - store one Q-function (parameterized by $\theta$) for each action
  - ex. $\pi(s) = \underset{a}{\max} \: \hat{Q}_\theta (s,a)$
    - this is discontinunous, instead often use *stochastic policy* representation (ex. softmax for $\pi_\theta (s,a)$)
  - learn $\theta$ that results in good performance
    - Q-learning learns actual Q* function - could be different (scaling factor etc.)
- to find $\pi$ maximize *policy value* $p(\theta) = $ expected reward executing $\pi_\theta$
  - could do this with sgd using *policy gradient*
  - when environment/policy is stochastic, more difficult
    1. could sample mutiple times to compute gradient
    2. REINFORCE algorithm - could approximate gradient at $\theta$ by just sampling at $\theta$: $\nabla_\theta p(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{(\nabla_\theta \pi_\theta (s, a_j)) R_j (s)}{\pi_\theta (s, a_j)}$
    3. PEGASUS - *correlated sampling* - ex. 2 blackjack programs would both be dealt same hands - want to see different policies on same things
    

# deep rl course

**[berkeley (sergey levine)](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)**

## "supervised rl" (imitation learning)

- imitation learning / behavioral cloning -- given pairs of observations / actions, learn policy to take action given observation $\pi_\theta(a_t|o_t)$
  - basic example: cost function is 0 when action is same as human's in data and 1 otherwise
  - usually inefficient / insufficient
- one improvement: DAgger (ross et al. 2011) - use learned policy to generate synthetic observations and have humans label those
  - we can query observations when deviate slightly from expert trajectory
- goal-conditioned behavioral cloning - subdivides data based on different goals - learn $\pi_\theta(a|s, g)$
  - example - given a goal location, take actions to move a robot there
- [Learning to Reach Goals via Iterated Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06088) (ghosh ... levine, 2020)
  - move robot arm based on policy (initially random)
  - see which random goals are met
  - use this as goal-conditioned behavioral cloning
  - update policy and repeat

## rl algorithms overview

- 3 general steps (iterated)
  - fit a model / estimate the return
  - improve the policy
  - generate samples (i.e. run the policy)
- $\theta^{\star}=\arg \max _{\theta} E_{\tau \sim p_{\theta}(\tau)}\left[\sum_{t} r\left(\mathbf{s}_{t}, \mathbf{a}_{t}\right)\right]$
  - *Value-based*: estimate value function or $Q$-function of the optimal policy (no explicit policy)
  - *Policy gradients*: directly differentiate the above objective
    - policy network $\pi_\theta(a|s)$
    - gradients are extremely noisy compared to supervised learning
  - *Actor-critic*: estimate value function or Q-function of the current policy (critic), use it to improve policy (actor)
  - *Model-based RL*: estimate the transition model, and then...
    - just use the model to plan (no plicy)
      - trajectory optimization/optimal control (continuous space) - optimize over actions
      - discrete planning - e.g. monte carlo tree search
    - backpropagate gradients into the policy
    - use the model to learn a value function

|                           | fit model / estimate return                    | improve policy                                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| value-based               | fit $V(s)$ or $Q(s, a)$                        | $\pi(s) = \text{argmax}_a Q(s, a)$                           |
| (direct) policy gradients | evaluate returns $R_\tau = \sum_t r(s_t, a_t)$ | $\theta = \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta E[\sum_t r(s_t, a_t)]$ |
| actor-critic              | fit $V(s)$ or $Q(s, a)$                        | $\theta = \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta E[Q(s, a)]$          |
| model-based               | maybe model $P(s'|s, a)$                       |                                                              |

- sample efficiency
  - on policy - must generate new samples each time the policy is changed
  - off policy - can improve policy without generating new samples from it (so look at a bunch of samples then update)
  - offline rl - data collected only once with any policy, then want to learn good policy from that

## other problems

### inverse rl

Inverse RL - learning reward functions from example

- ai should be uncertain about utitilies
- utilties should be inferred from human preferences
- in systems that interact, need to express preferences in terms of game theory
- can solve it with a GAN: e.g. [A Connection between Generative Adversarial Networks, Inverse Reinforcement Learning, and Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03852) (finn et al. 2016)
- [Apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning | Proceedings of the twenty-first international conference on Machine learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1015330.1015430?casa_token=inLo77c-zqAAAAAA:JirDplyZ_94a7A0WXavY3V5napVOxdJ5Qjkzin02K4bapip6D5bQNuPAefmkYeYAb9OSVyqkEKRcCJs) (abbeel & ng, 2004) - good intro to inverse RL

### planning

- [Efficient Learning in Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Neural Networks - The Case of Maze Navigation Problem](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4220851?casa_token=Nw_d05ju8VcAAAAA:iXvxp_PDrMHtsoIk1_g2CnPPGFdMZcu_PqcyeyFUXsGrQWoQFRz8JvRmzjgofdwlQKYdsfpvK-g) (ilin et al. 2007) - explored connections between planning algorithms and recurrent NNs
- [Value Iteration Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867) (tamar...levine, & abbeel, 2017)
  - represent value iteration as a fully differentiable DNN using recurrence

### metalearning

- learning to learn (very close to multi-task learning)
  - e.g. learn optimizer, representation
  - e.g. learn how to explore
  - e.g. learn how to do RL for various different walking tasks and then generalize to new walking task with few samples
  - [Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/finn17a.html) (finn, levine, & abbeel, 2017) - treat metalearner itself as an RL algorithm
- multitask learning
  - sometimes have the ability to decide which new tasks to add (e.g. by changing simulator)

### offline rl

- core issue with offline RL: want policy that improves over the training policy, but canâ€™t deviate from the training policy due to distr. shift
- one idea: instead of collecting new samples with policy, reweight samples using importance sampling based on policy
- [IQL: Implicit Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169) (ashvinâ€™s paper, 2021)
  - IQL - foregoes need to evaluate unseen actions
