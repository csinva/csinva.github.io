# breiman
- conversation
  - moved sf -> la -> caltech (physics) -> columbia (math) -> berkeley (math)
  - info theory + gambling
  - CART, ace, and prob book, bagging
  - ucla prof., then consultant, then founded stat computing at berkeley
  - lots of cool outside activities
    - ex. selling ice in mexico
- 2 cultures paper
  1. *generative* - data are generated by a given stochastic model
    - stat does this too much and needs to move to 2
    - ex. assume y = f(x, noise, parameters)
    - validation: goodness-of-fit and residuals
  2. *predictive* - use algorithmic model and data mechanism unknown
    - assume nothing about x and y
    - ex. generate P(x, y) with neural net
    - validation: prediction accuracy
  - axioms
    1. Occam
    2. *Rashomon* - lots of different good models, which explains best?
      - ex. rf is not robust at all
    3. *Bellman* - curse of dimensionality
      - might actually want to increase dimensionality (ex. svms embedded in higher dimension)
  - industry was problem-solving, academia had too much culture


# box + tukey
- questions
  1. what points are relevant and irrelevant today in both papers? 
    - relevant
      - box
        - thoughts on scientific method
        - solns should be simple
        - necessity for developing experimental design
        - flaws (cookbookery, mathematistry)
      - tukey
        - separating data analysis and stats
        - all models have flaws
        - no best models
        - lots of goold old techniques (e.g. LSR)
    - irrelevant
      - some of the data techniques (I think)
      - tukey multiple-response data has been better attacked (graphical models)
  2. how do you think the personal traits of Tukey and Box relate to the scientific opinions expressed in their papers?
    - probably both pretty critical of the science at the time
    - box - great respect for Fisher
    - both very curious in different fields of science
  3. what is the most valuable msg that you get from each paper?
    - box - data analysis is a science
    - tukey - models must be useful
      - no best models
      - find data that is useful
      - no best models
- box_79 "science and statistics"
  - scientific method - iteration between theory and practice
    - learning - discrepancy between theory and practice
    - solns should be simple
  - fisher - founder of statistics (early 1900s)
    - couples math with applications
    - data analysis - subiteration between tentative model and tentative analysis
    - develops experimental design
  - flaws
    - *cookbookery* - forcing all problems into 1 or 2 routine techniques
    - *mathematistry* - development of theory for theory's sake
- tukey_62 "the future of data analysis"
  - general considerations
    - data analysis - different from statistics, is a science
    - lots of techniques are very old (LS - Gauss, 1803)
    - all models have flaws
    - no best models
    - must teach multiple data analysis methods
  - spotty data - lots of irregularly non-constant variability
    - could just trim highest and lowest values
      - *winzorizing* - replace suspect values with closest values that aren't
    - must decide when to use new techniques, even when not fully understood
    - want some automation
    - FUNOP - fulll normal plot
      - can be visualized in table
  - spotty data in more complex situations
    - FUNOR-FUNOM
  - multiple-response data
    - understudied except for factor analysis
    - multiple-response procedures have been modeled upon how early single-response procedures were supposed to have been used, rather than upon how they were in fact used
    - factor analysis
      1. reduce dimensionality with new coordinates
      2. rotate to find meaningful coordinates
      - can use multiple regression factors as one factor if they are very correlated
    - regression techniques always offer hopes of learning more from less data than do variance-component techniques
  - flexibility of attack
    - ex. what unit to measure in
