  - most fundamental principle enshrined in liberalism is one of tolerance
  - newer understanding: liberalism is not simply a mechanism for pragmatically avoiding violent conflict, but also a means of protecting fundamental human dignity

  - from 1950-1970s, liberal democracy flourished
  - first discontent: economic
    - neoliberalism - pejorative, overly free markets
      - aggregate incomes rise, but so does inequality
  - second discontent: cultural
    - liberal state does not tell you how to live your life, often filled with consumerism etc.
    - stress on individualism contradicts biological social nature of people
    - critics of liberalism on the right feel that it has undervalued the nation and traditional national identity
